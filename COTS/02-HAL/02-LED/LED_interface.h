/** \brief	The function LED_voidLedInit initializes the direction of three LEDs, namely a blue LED, a green LED, 
 *			and a red LED by configuring the corresponding pins of the microcontroller as output pins.
 *
 *			The function first calls DIO_voidInit function which initializes the microcontroller's general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins, 
 *			specifically the ones associated with port F.
 *
 *			Then, the function configures the direction of each LED by calling DIO_u8SetPinDirection function three times, passing the port number (DIO_u8_PORTF) and the pin numbers (LED_BLUE_PIN, LED_GREEN_PIN, and LED_RED_PIN) as 
 *			arguments with the third argument being DIO_u8_OUTPUT to set the pins as output.
 *			This function is likely part of a larger program that controls the behavior of the LEDs.

 *			When the value of copy_u8LedColour matches one of the defined LED colors, the corresponding pin is set to

 *			as well as the value DIO_u8_LOW, which represents a logic low voltage level.
 *
 *			The DIO_u8SetPinValue function is likely a low-level function that interacts with the microcontroller's 
 *			hardware to set the voltage level of a specific pin. The port and pin numbers specified in the function 
 *			calls correspond to the specific pins of the microcontroller that are connected to the LEDs. By setting the voltage 
 *			level of these pins to logic low, the function effectively turns off all three LEDs.
